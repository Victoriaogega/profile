    <p>I have learnt that one has to understand the user requirements and use the human centred design to come up with a good product that satifies the user requirement.The product has to be technologically feasible,it has to be desired and it must have a good business viability too.To understand the user requirements, one has to carry out research. There are various types of research such as primary and secondary.after undertaking the user reseach, one has to ideate and build prototypes. One will the test according to the user feedback. One will also carry out test to ensure there are no bugs and that the product meets the user requirements. </p>
